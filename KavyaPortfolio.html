                        Hi again! I'm Kavya. I'm an incoming transfer student at UC Irvine. <br/>
                        I will be majoring in Software Engineering.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I've recently developed an interest in web development, so as a <br/>
                        first project, I created this website. I intend it to work as a <br/>
                        personal portfolio showcasing projects that I will be working on!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion however is healthcare. I hope to work in healthcare and <br/>
                        work on programming medical devices. I am especially interested in <br/>
                        surgical robots and wish to work in this part of the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a college student with no work experience, I am still learning skills <br/>
                        through college courses and personal projects. I hope to get an internship <br/>
                        and apply the skills I learned into a real work setting!

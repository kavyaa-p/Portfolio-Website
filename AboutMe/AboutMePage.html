                <p>
                    Hi again! I'm Kavya. I'm an incoming transfer student at UC Irvine.
                    I will be majoring in Software Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've recently developed an interest in web development, so as a
                    first project, I created this website. I intend it to work as a
                    personal portfolio showcasing projects that I will be working on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion however is healthcare. I hope to work in healthcare and
                    work on programming medical devices. I am especially interested in
                    surgical robots and wish to work in this part of the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a college student with no work experience, I am still learning skills
                    through college courses and personal projects. I hope to get an internship
                    and apply the skills I learned into a real work setting!
                </p>

                        This website was created to showcase various projects I have made so far and
                        plan on making in the future. The development of the site is still in progress. <br><br>

                        So far, the website has been made purely through HTML and CSS. I hope to
                        soon refresh my knowledge in JavaScript and include animations and other
                        components of the website that JavaScript is necessary for. I also hope to
                        later make the website accessible/viewable on devices of different dimentions.

                    <p>
                        This project was created as the first project in the Android App Development course offered by
                        Codepath. The app was created full through Java and was intended to work as an app that displays a
                        list of current movie showings at the theatres. <br><br>

                        The app implements the Movie Database API to display the list of movies at theatres. It also utilizes open-source libraries such as the Android Async HTTP to
                        get HTTP requests asynchronously with JSON parsing and also Glide to load images and cache libraries for Androids.

                        This website was created as a final project for my web development class. Unfortunately,
                        I do not have an image/GIF of the website nor do I have the code. <br><br>

                        The website was fully built with HTML and CSS. The website was built dynamically in
                        the sense that the dimensions of each page altered based on the device dimensions it's 
                        being viewed on. A navigation bar was also carefully implemented to help users easily
                        navigate through each page on the website.
